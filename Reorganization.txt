Followed this guide in reorganization
https://exploreflask.com/en/latest/organizing.html

Step 1 Reorganization of Top Level: 
    Reorganzied top level folder structure such that the front end and back end are seperated 
    Called the folders: Swift and Flask

    Made extra folder since in the beginning it was very hard to find where the code for swift was, so I made an extra folder called swift_code to contrast swift_text. Please insert working code into new folder.

    Unsure of where a few files should be so I left them on the outside for now. 
    Located folder uploads, saw that it contained a ".keep" file with nothing in it. I deleted this file since it did not appear in any backend code. (If it is in front end please reinstall)

Step 2 Shallow cleanup of backend files:
    Following the guide created a config.py 
        "This file contains most of the configuration variables that your app needs."
        Moved all code that dealt with configuration to this new file. 
    
    Created a __init__.py file:
        "This file initializes your application and brings together all of the various components."
        Database initialization was moved from app.py to init.py

    Noticed a file called a standalone test file for arrest_booking that showed the logic for code. In the end, decided to delete that since the logic was shown to be correct and was no longer needed.
    This makes sense especially since we have an actual test for the arrest_booking form now. 
    
    It looks much neater now 

    Stumbled upon this https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/patterns/packages/ guide
    Will proceed to follow it. 

    It mentioned a possible error that in order to get it running, setup.py is needed as well as some enviormental variables, so look at article. 


Step 3 Indepth cleanup of app.py code: 

    The remaining code in app.py is mainly views. It is all routes. The previous article mentioned a views.py file.
    After some research, found some documentation on views.py. 
        https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/views/
        " Views.py handle the requests and return responses"

    
        Mentioned blueprints. When I have more time, will look on how to refactor our code into blueprints. 

    Need to add correct import statements to views.py, app.py, config.py, and __init__.py to make sure the app can run. 
    Some code in app.py uses config.py, so look at that as well. 

    Got confused on the difference on app.py vs views.py. Looked at this article and will try to implement. 
    https://exploreflask.com/en/latest/views.html 
    It shows examples of both files. 

    In the end, the project looks much neater overall. 

    
    Note: When we switch to SQL, we might need a models.py and migrations folder. 
        "models.py is the place where we are going to store our data models and the entities and relationships between the data will be specified."
        "Migrations’ folder stores database and it’s specific information as it relates to the models."

            Some code in app.py uses config.py, so look at that as well.
