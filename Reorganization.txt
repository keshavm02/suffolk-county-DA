Followed this guide in reorganization

Step 1 Reorganization of Top Level: 
    Reorganzied top level folder structure such that the front end and back end are seperated 
    Called the folders: Swift and Flask

    Made extra folder since in the beginning it was very hard to find where the code for swift was, so I made an extra folder called swift_code to contrast swift_text. Please insert working code into new folder.

    Unsure of where a few files should be so I left them on the outside for now. 
    Located folder uploads, saw that it contained a ".keep" file with nothing in it. I deleted this file since it did not appear in any backend code. (If it is in front end please reinstall)

Step 2 Shallow cleanup of backend files:
    Following the guide created a config.py 
        "This file contains most of the configuration variables that your app needs."
        Moved all code that dealt with configuration to this new file. 
    
    Created a __init__.py file:
        "This file initializes your application and brings together all of the various components."
        Database initialization was moved from app.py to init.py
    
    Noticed a file called a standalone test file for arrest_booking that showed the logic for code. In the end, decided to delete that since the logic was shown to be correct and was no longer needed.
    This makes sense especially since we have an actual test for the arrest_booking form now. 
    
    It looks much neater now 

Step 3 Indepth cleanup of app.py code:
